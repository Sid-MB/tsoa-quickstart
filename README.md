# TSOA Quickstart

This is a quickstart for [TSOA](https://tsoa-community.github.io/docs/), containing the example from their "[Getting Started](https://tsoa-community.github.io/docs/getting-started.html)" page. 

Other features (implemented following the TSOA docs):
- [Live Reloading](https://tsoa-community.github.io/docs/live-reloading.html)
- [SwaggerUI](https://tsoa-community.github.io/docs/live-reloading.html#supercharging-our-developer-experience-with-swaggerui) API documentation generation, available at `/docs`

## Building & Running

```sh
yarn run build  # Build the API
yarn run start  # Start the API server

```
